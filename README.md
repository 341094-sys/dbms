Hospital Management System

A structured database system designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including patient records, doctor details, appointments, treatments, billing, and administrative workflows.  

Overview

The Hospital Management System (HMS) database aims to streamline and digitize core operations of a hospital.
It follows standard DBMS principles, includes normalized tables, and is built using SQL.
The project demonstrates complete database lifecycle design: requirement analysis → ER diagram → schema creation → data population → query execution.

Project Objectives

To model a real-world hospital system using entity–relationship principles.

To maintain accurate, reliable, and normalized medical records.

To enable efficient retrieval of information through SQL queries.

To ensure data integrity through primary/foreign key constraints.

Relationships

One doctor → many appointments

One patient → many reports

One patient → many treatments

One department → many doctors

One room → allocated to one patient at a time
