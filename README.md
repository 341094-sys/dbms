Hospital Management System
A structured database system designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including patient records, doctor details, appointments, treatments, billing, and administrative workflows.  

Overview

The Hospital Management System (HMS) database aims to streamline and digitize core operations of a hospital.
It follows standard DBMS principles, includes normalized tables, and is built using SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle — can adapt as needed).
The project demonstrates complete database lifecycle design: requirement analysis → ER diagram → schema creation → data population → query execution.
